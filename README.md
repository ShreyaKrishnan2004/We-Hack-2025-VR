# We-Hack-2025-VR

This Unity project uses live drone footage in a VR environment to assess the health of cell towers. The system combines computer vision, custom shaders, and haptic feedback to help field engineers identify anomalies without physically climbing towers—enhancing safety and reducing cost.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎥 **Drone Video Integration**: Real-time or recorded drone footage displayed in Unity.
- 🕶️ **VR Immersion**: Supports Oculus devices for immersive inspection.
- 🟥 **Computer Vision Overlay**: Bounding boxes identify towers and highlight detected anomalies.
- 🌡️ **Thermal Imaging Shader**: Simulated thermal effect to visualize heat-based anomalies.
- 🤖 **Haptic Feedback**: Vibrational actuators alert users to key regions requiring attention.
